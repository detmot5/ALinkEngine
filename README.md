# ALink engine 

#### First cross-platform graphic engine designed specifically for developing Low-Code tools.

Based on C++ and OpenGL.
##### At the begining, why C++ instead of more High-Level solutions like Electron?
The main goal is creating a reliable, expandable, and high-performace platform for Low-Code development
with a lot features like software debugging, unit-testing, integrating with code editors and IDE's,
technology-specific scripts eg. uploading software to microcontrollers or running development servers.
And also the goal is to make it able to run even on very old hardware with small anmount of RAM, so the JavaScript based frameworks might not meet the requirements. 
But the main reason is that C++ is just cool :) 


##### C++ standard - C++17

##### Compiler
  * Windows - MinGW
  * Linux - Gcc
  * Mac - This day ALink keeps apple away ;) 
  > Every line of code must be tested on every supported platform!

##### Build System 
  * CMake

##### Tools 
  * Scripts for linux build on windows using WSL

##### Code style guide 
Based on Java
* Braces at the same line
* Names of classes starts with a capital letter and has a capital letter for each new word
* Names of functions and variables written in camelCase

It's fully free and open source.
